###  Machine Learning Project
---  

</center>

## Problem Statement:
Pre-owned Car Price Prediction
Develop a Machine Learning model that predicts the correct price of a pre-owned car.
Ensure the model uses an up-to-date dataset relevant to the Indian car market.
Consider various factors that affect a carâ€™s price for accurate predictions.

## Process Flow of Project:
1. Understanding Problem Statement
2. Getting System Ready
3. Data Collection
4. Understanding the Data Description
5. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 
6. Data Analysis 
7. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 
8. Insights from Data Visualization
9. Feature Engineering
10. Model Buidling & Evaluation
11. Insights from Data Visualization
12. Encoding
12. Selection of Best Model 
13. Generating Pickle file
14. Developing Frontend
15. Integrating ML model with Frontend

## Approach:
We propose to develop a machine learning model that can predict the price of a used car based on its features. The model will be trained on a dataset of used cars that have been sold on Cardekho.com in India. The model will then be able to be used to predict the price of any used car, given its features.

## Objective:
To build suitable Machine Learning Model for Used Car Price Prediction.

## Benefits:
The benefits of this solution include:
1. Sellers will be able to more accurately price their cars which will help them to sell their cars faster and for a higher price.
2. Buyers will be able to find cars that are priced more competitively.
3. The overall used car market in India will become more efficient.

**We believe that this project has the potential to make a significant impact on the used car market in India.**
